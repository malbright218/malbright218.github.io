            I am an engineer by education but have spent my career working as a multi-faceted thinker in a medium sized manufacturing firm.  For the past seven years I have been gaining experience through all facets of a medium sized business, from Operations and Finance to Logistics and Production.  In my time at Accurate Box Comapany I have spearheaded many projects ranging in costs from the tens of thousands to the tens of millions.

            I am currently studying as a web developer with the goal of advancing in my career.  My personal belief is that as technology develops and grows, it is your duty to develop and grow with it as best you can.  I set goals to myself every year to learn something new and I intend to keep this up as long as possible.

            I am a proud husband and proud father of a one and a half year old daughter.  She makes every day of mine better and is my greatest accomplishment to date.  Everything I do, I do for her and my goal is to provide for my family in the best ways possible.  I am also the proud parent of a large goofball golden retreiver named Gordie who makes laugh every day.  My family is my support and I am theirs.
